# Custom-SVM-kernel
The repo builds upon the Neural Architecture Search(NAS) technique to find a kernel function for the SVM over MNIST dataset.  
1000 samples are used to train the SVM while the reward for the controller is the accuracy over a validation set of 500 samples.  
The final results below are the accuracy for the entire 10000 test samples of MNIST.
